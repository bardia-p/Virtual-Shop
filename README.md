```
Then exit the folder and run either of the follwing commands to access the UIs:
```shell

- You can quit the store at any time by clicking the quit button which empties your cart and returns all of its contents to the inventory. Clicking the quit button results in the following message:

</p>

- Notice that once you start the program the number of stores is set to 3 by default which opens 3 stores at once. You can treat these windows as 3 separate clients and work on each one individually. Note that once you switch between the stores the content of their inventories will be updated according to your last actions. You can also resize the windows for easier use!
